# Kicking Away the Crutches of Agile

@garyfleming

^ Intro


^^ notes
^ Super early beta draft
^^ Much shorter, fewer ideas explored, and less well
^^ More ranty, less balanced/considered
^^ No jokes, few cat pictures, -> Quick cat picture


^ What do I mean by kicking away the crutches of agile?
^^ Metaphor. I do not condone kicking away actual crutches
^^ What does it mean? Sometimes we need a crutch to help us for a while, but we need to recognise when that's hindering us. When we should be doing more physio so that we can walk, and run, and dance...

^ Value
^^ What in "agile" do we find valuable?
^^ Retros
^^ Collaboration
^^ Self-organisation
^^^ The work we're doing is a team sport. The idea of the lone developer being a firefighting hero is over. It was never desirable in the first place. The idea that managers had to "sweat the resources" was never desirable in the first place. The things above help us work together; with care, kindness, and reflection.

^ Manifest Destiny
^^ Manifesto: that Doc Norton Tweet. https://twitter.com/DocOnDev/status/1035195859456147456
^^ Manifesto values: Look carefully: the left hand side are notions of working together collaboratively without structure, the right hand size is management/structure/control.
^^ Manifesto principles: no real ceremonies in there. No structure is implied. If you can benefit from one, use it, sure, but you don't need to. No-one was saying you did. You could argue that "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly" implies a Retrospective ceremony. I wouldn't strongly disagree, but I'd argue there might be better ways in some circumstances.

^ Cadence
^^ Cadence is the use of time as an enabling constraint
^^ Time as an enabling constraint is **always** a crutch. There is always a better measure. Can be harder to see. Can be harder to track. It's always there.
^^ 

^ Continuous Delivery
^^ We used to push to prod every 3-6-12 months. Awful weekends of releases. Usually not quite what anyone wanted. Slow feedback etc
^^  We can see that a world of continuous delivery is valuable. Indisputably so. ... Why? (feedback, time to market, etc)
^^ We know that it wasn't possible in a waterfall world. Those h



^ Prefer dancing to sprinting
^^ Sprinting is dysfunctional, bursty, tiring. Lockstep sync points, end of sprint ceremonies, management by sprint/velocity (bookkeeping approach),

^ How do we actually do any of this?
^^ Can't just kill suddenly change things. Can't say sprints are universally bad. Find value. Find dysfunction.
