# Kicking Away the Crutches of Agile

@garyfleming

^ Who I am.

---

# v0.0.1 - Super Early Beta Draft

^ Super early beta draft
^^ Much shorter, fewer ideas explored, and less well
^^ More ranty, less balanced/considered
^^ No jokes, few cat pictures,

# Crutches: A Metaphor

![](images/crutches.jpg)

^ What do I mean by kicking away the crutches of agile?
^^ Metaphor. I do not condone kicking away actual crutches. Nor am I implying that, in the real world, away from the metaphor, that people don't need walking aids or are in any way **lesser** for using them

---

# Hurt

![original](images/hurt.jpg)

^^ What does it mean?
^^ Sometimes we get hurt or injure ourselves for a while, maybe falling off a waterfall,
^^ Sometimes we need a crutch to help us for a while, because it's better than when we were hurt.
^^ but we need to recognise when it's hindering us.
^^ When we should be doing more physio, to be a bit more agile.
^^ so that we can walk, and run, and dance... Whatever we need to do at any given time

---

# Value

![original](images/value.jpg)

^^ That is, we should be focussing on the things we value, not the means by which we do them.

---

# Forgotten Value

^ A while back I was getting fed-up seeing rote forms of agile. People doing the scrum they learned from someone else. People following a process with which they had absolutely no engagement. Meme-copying. Cargo culting. They'd forgotten the value



---

# What in "agile" do we find valuable?

^^ Retros
^^ Self-organisation
^^ Collaboration

---

# People. It's a team sport.

![](images/team-sport.jpg)

^ It's about people. Working together. Well.
^^^ The work we're doing is a team sport.
^The idea of the lone developer being a firefighting hero is over. It was never desirable in the first place.
^ The idea that managers had to "sweat the resources" was never desirable in the first place.
^ The things above help us work together; with care, kindness, and reflection.

![fit original](images/norton-manifesto.png)

^ It's not like Agile itself prevents this.
^^ Manifesto: that Doc Norton Tweet. https://twitter.com/DocOnDev/status/1035195859456147456

| x | y|
| --- | ---: |
| Individuals and Interactions | Processes and Tools |
| Working Software | Comprehensive Documentation |
| Customer Collaboration | Contract Negotiation |
| Responding to Change | Following a Plan|

^^ We can see that in the Manifesto values: Look carefully. What do you see.

---

| Collaboration | Management |
| --- | ---: |
| Individuals and Interactions | Processes and Tools |
| Working Software | Comprehensive Documentation |
| Customer Collaboration | Contract Negotiation |
| Responding to Change | Following a Plan|

^^ The left hand side are notions of working together collaboratively without structure, the right hand size is management/structure/control.

---

# Manifesto Principles?

^^ Manifesto principles: no real ceremonies in there. No structure is implied. If you can benefit from one, use it, sure, but you don't need to. No-one was saying you did.
^ You could argue that "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly" implies a Retrospective ceremony. I wouldn't strongly disagree, but I'd argue there might be better ways in some circumstances.

---

# What crutches are stopping us?

^ So what crutches do we have that are stopping us from truly embracing agile? What practices are we copying for the ease of it that we might get rid of?

---

# Cadence

^^ Cadence is the use of time as an enabling constraint
^^ Time as an enabling constraint is **always** a crutch. There is always a better measure. Can be harder to see. Can be harder to track. It's always there.

---

# Cadence and New Year's Resolutions

![](images/nyr.jpg)

^ Someone told me once, in late-October, that they were planning to start going to the gym in January. A new year's resolution.
^ We had a chat and it was clear it was something they wanted to do to aid in their goals (overall fitness, losing weight).
^ I asked why wait? Were there things making it difficult to do it now that wouldn't be there in January?
^ They thought about it and realised the answer was no.
^ They had become so fixated on time, they hadn't looked beyond it. Pushing off change to a later date that could deliver greater value NOW.

---

# Forget Sprints: Get Greater Value Now

^ The work we do rarely fits exactly into a sprint. When it seems to, it's usually artificially fitted to the arbitrary time constraint.

---

# Forget Sprints: Customer Collaboration

^ If we have a CI/CD world where our customers see the latest thing at least once a day, we should use that as our feedback loop. We should be working with our customers daily to figure out, given what we collectively know, what we should be doing right now.
^ NOT what we might start in two weeks time.

---

# Forget Sprints: Respond to Change

^ If we want to respond to change meaningfully, it helps to avoid filling up multiple weeks worth of a schedule. As well as working with out customers, we should be able to handle interruptions when they happen. We should be able to take onboard new learning quickly.

---


# What about retros?

^ You can still do retros on cadence if you want. I'd see inspecting and adapting on cadence as a minimum threshold.

---

^^ TODO! more on cadence

^ Continuous Delivery
^^ We used to push to prod every 3-6-12 months. Awful weekends of releases. Usually not quite what anyone wanted. Slow feedback etc
^^  We can see that a world of continuous delivery is valuable. Indisputably so. ... Why? (feedback, time to market, etc)
^^ We know that it wasn't possible in a waterfall world. Those h



^ Prefer dancing to sprinting
^^ Sprinting is dysfunctional, bursty, tiring. Lockstep sync points, end of sprint ceremonies, management by sprint/velocity (bookkeeping approach),

^ How do we actually do any of this?
^^ Can't just kill suddenly change things. Can't say sprints are universally bad. Find value. Find dysfunction.
