# Possible TODOs.

* POssibly framing device: Explaining what anarchy really is
* Cadences and new years resolutions -- waiting when you can act.
* Cadence is always a crutch. Delve into why and better alternatives.
* Frameworks are usually a crutch. Make us feel better that we have a method to use, but often before we know why.
* ..."they want numbers to hold against teams/ justify why they believed people they don't trust." https://twitter.com/m4rkchapman/status/1009916688148492288
* Design Sprints as an enabling constraint
* Hierarchy as both enabling and disabling constraint. Where does this lead us? Anarchy? Holocracy? They're also problematic
* “I had some terrible consultants in my team, so we wrote a guide that they could follow to run through with their teams.” — simplified. Boiled down. But it helps
* Meme copying is generally unhelpful. The Spotify Model shouldn't be your model, because it doesn't fit you. Fitting your org to a model is backwards. Especially because the Spotify Model was **never** a fully-realized model; they never did it across the whole org. (rewatch Joakim Sunden's talk https://vimeo.com/240125835)
* Continuous integration and continuous delivery are examples of the benefits when we remove our constraints and ingrained ways of working -- faster, cheaper, safer, with more learning. Provably (thanks state of devops)
* Bring in elements of The Wedding Ritual and/or Agile without Ceremony
* Signal: irregular flow at certain points might indicate good point to remove cadence. Particularly around early phase/planning.
* Cadence: https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/12/teams-decouple-cadences
* Cadence of ceremonies can be a sign of immaturity. You're using time as a substitute for more directly related things. Can be useful in some/many contexts (like if you're immature as a team, or have other areas of concern), but we can look beyond it. Example: Planning. Want to decide next thing of value, come up with an experiment of how to achieve that, figure out whether it worked. Needs constrained in some way, but "two week sprint every time" is crude. What other constraints could you use? What does the board tell us?
* Cadence: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/944711411032297472
* More cadence: https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/944607039220830209
* Off-cadence: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/951599519812251650
* Cadence and time boxes: https://twitter.com/mattbarcomb/status/956650500967096320
* Using lack of fixed iteration means better control of WIP. Not pulling in a bunch of stuff every N weeks, gives the advantages we'd expect from smaller WIP. More feedback and learning makes it in.
* Estimation in time/t-shirt sizes/whatever, vs complexity estimates
* Look at some models and attack: Scrum, XP
* Retrospective coherence - Talk about memories. Your first childhood memory of going through the piazza in your red buggy. Describe details. Then reveal it's in 3rd person. Most memories are. Explain retrospective coherence. Explain how it fits with how we adopt models.
* The manifesto doesn't have a model. It has few practices. It has one ceremony.
* Accountability for deliver: if everyone is accountable, then no-one is.
* Marquet: Autonomy is enabled by alignment and competence
* Talk about autonomy as more tractable than anarachy. Doesn't mean do whatever we want, but less constrained than models.
* Autonomy and CI/CD and continuous experimentation come from excellence
