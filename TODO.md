# Possible TODOs.

* Possible frame: a short rant about dogs. About how they're the same species. How we shaped them and created breeds. Working dogs with purposes. Aesthetic diversity. But a growing sickness: we favoured short-term outcomes and feeling good over systemic health. 
* Interesting framing device: https://twitter.com/antz29/status/1058402396597043201
* ""We know the one true way to manage the software lifecycle. We don't actually write software, but we can certify you."" https://twitter.com/DocOnDev/status/1035195859456147456
* Talk about crutches, not going for physio etc
* Worth talking about why we have crutches, why they're essential.
* Worth mentioning the limits of the crutches metaphor explicitly. People often need mobility aids in real-life and that doesn't make them, in any way, lesser.
* Possibly expand the metaphor to tell people to beware of Faith Healers
* POssibly framing device: Explaining what anarchy really is
* Cadences and new years resolutions -- waiting when you can act.
* Cadence is always a crutch. Delve into why and better alternatives.
* Frameworks are usually a crutch. Make us feel better that we have a method to use, but often before we know why.
* ..."they want numbers to hold against teams/ justify why they believed people they don't trust." https://twitter.com/m4rkchapman/status/1009916688148492288
* Design Sprints as an enabling constraint
* Hierarchy as both enabling and disabling constraint. Where does this lead us? Anarchy? Holocracy? They're also problematic
* “I had some terrible consultants in my team, so we wrote a guide that they could follow to run through with their teams.” — simplified. Boiled down. But it helps
* Meme copying is generally unhelpful. The Spotify Model shouldn't be your model, because it doesn't fit you. Fitting your org to a model is backwards. Especially because the Spotify Model was **never** a fully-realized model; they never did it across the whole org. Rewatch Joakim Sunden's talk  https://vimeo.com/240125835 . Its all good but the spotify model bit is at 20:50ish
* Good thread on what Spotify actually did: https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1059672837311488000
* Continuous integration and continuous delivery are examples of the benefits when we remove our constraints and ingrained ways of working -- faster, cheaper, safer, with more learning. Provably (thanks state of devops)
* Bring in elements of The Wedding Ritual and/or Agile without Ceremony
* Signal: irregular flow at certain points might indicate good point to remove cadence. Particularly around early phase/planning.
* Cadence: https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/12/teams-decouple-cadences
* Cadence of ceremonies can be a sign of immaturity. You're using time as a substitute for more directly related things. Can be useful in some/many contexts (like if you're immature as a team, or have other areas of concern), but we can look beyond it. Example: Planning. Want to decide next thing of value, come up with an experiment of how to achieve that, figure out whether it worked. Needs constrained in some way, but "two week sprint every time" is crude. What other constraints could you use? What does the board tell us?
* Cadence: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/944711411032297472
* More cadence: https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/944607039220830209
* Off-cadence: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/951599519812251650
* Cadence and time boxes: https://twitter.com/mattbarcomb/status/956650500967096320
* Using lack of fixed iteration means better control of WIP. Not pulling in a bunch of stuff every N weeks, gives the advantages we'd expect from smaller WIP. More feedback and learning makes it in.
* Estimation in time/t-shirt sizes/whatever, vs complexity estimates
* Look at some models and attack: Scrum, XP
* Retrospective coherence - Talk about memories. Your first childhood memory of going through the piazza in your red buggy. Describe details. Then reveal it's in 3rd person. Most memories are. Explain retrospective coherence. Explain how it fits with how we adopt models.
* The manifesto doesn't have a model. It has few practices. It has one ceremony.
* Standups are on a daily cadence. Feels like a minimum. We should be constantly collaborating so they're less useful. Talking daily IS A MINIMUM.
* Accountability for deliver: if everyone is accountable, then no-one is.
* Marquet: Autonomy is enabled by alignment and competence
* Talk about autonomy as more tractable than anarachy. Doesn't mean do whatever we want, but less constrained than models.
* Autonomy and CI/CD and continuous experimentation come from excellence
* Could talk about Valve software. Tyranny of structurelessness
* Team stability is important. Is this orthogonal?
* People want/need predictability. Basing this off real data on a day to day basis is more accurate and reflective of change than using sprint planning analytics, with a resolution of weeks where the work is guessed at.
* Most certifications are a crutch.
* An overarching theme might be that we start by describing agile in the manifesto, using it to argue for alternatives to the current frameworks and structures and all the other bits we want, then at the end we tear down the manifesto itself.
* Models are imperfect but helpful: https://twitter.com/MartinBurnsSCO/status/1044456649971372032
* Spotify model only works for spotify: https://twitter.com/mfloryan/status/1046076483100430336
* Linear flow boards. Some flow isn’t linear. There are better visualisations
* If we keep the dance metaphor alive, we could bookend the talk with something on Benesh Movement Notation
* retrospective formats. A handful of standards, all probing the same thing. Stop, start, continue. Lacked, liked, lalala. Million better ways to go. Lots of avenues to explore. Team harmony. How do other teams view you?
* https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/1051788704401027072. My idea here is that some forms are rote or generic. Gives space for ideas but also kills them with lack of imagination/spark of interest. Sometimes we want specific probing and questions
* https://twitter.com/mattbarcomb/status/1051888221926248448
* Sal's talk from FFS Conf.  Session facilitation where we make people think on their feet isn't great. Most ceremonies should be a starting point, not an ending point, of the conversation.  https://cucumber.io/blog/2018/10/04/ffs-not-everyone-likes-thinking-on-their-feet
* Goals of a retro: http://blog.gdinwiddie.com/2012/05/30/goals-of-a-retrospective/
* Retros are not continuous improvement: https://www.extremeuncertainty.com/retros-not-continuous-improvement/
* Tuckman was wrong: https://onbelay.co/articles/2017/5/5/tuckman-was-wrong
* More uncovering better ways, less bad-mouthing existing ways: https://twitter.com/CatSwetel/status/1057314815927115781
* Thread on recipes: https://twitter.com/MartinBurnsSCO/status/1060957799906189312
* make sure ceremonies make sense  contextually. IT services helpdesks probably don’t want Scrum.
* More on recipes: https://twitter.com/lunivore/status/1061979301908758528
* Stable teams have been a long held belief. Talk about Dynamic Reteaming (Heidi Helfand)
* Recipes :) https://twitter.com/existentialcoms/status/1062080092774363137
* Focussed retros. Pick a single topic and chat about that. Doesn't need much structure. Examples: code reviews. Mobbing. Planning. etc
* Jabe Bloom on context for tool fit: https://twitter.com/cyetain/status/1062715771636379649
* Chris McD on Cadence as a constraint: https://twitter.com/chrisvmcd/status/1063351351537737728
* More frequent retro s (every few hours): https://twitter.com/caro_sauve/status/1066349315126218753
* Cadenced rituals are fine, but most stuff in them should already be known: https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1065491034015027200
