# Beyond Frameworks: Thinking and Tools

## Alt. title: Learn to Be Agile Without Frameworks


## Abstract

“Someone sold them the training wheels, but they don’t have the bike yet” - Kyle Bremner.

Frameworks. Methodologies. Ceremonies. Manifestos. Some would say they represent the collective wisdom of our community. Others would say we often buy things wholesale to avoid having to engage our brains. The truth is messier.

From the idea of cadence to the ceremonies of Scrum, let's examine the value of the scaffolding of Agile and try to think more clearly about what we need. What we __really__ need. We'll find alternatives to the common solutions we see, and figure out how to look for our own contextual answers, rather than just copying what Spotify did again.

We'll separate the Why from the What, the Wheat from the Chaff, the Agile from the marketing.

## Learning Outcomes

1. You'll see why Agile is not about frameworks, it's about people!
2. You'll get a bunch of new ways of using Agile tools that aren't part of a heavy framework.
3. You'll see that the things you dislike about Agile can be fun with just a little thought
